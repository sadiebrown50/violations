<div class="text">
    <p> East Flatbush ranked higher than any other Community District in New York City for the rate of serious housing code violations in buildings with six or more units, according to the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development’s (ANHD) 2021 <a href=”https://anhd.org/report/how-affordable-housing-threatened-your-neighborhood-2021”>Housing Risk Chart.</a> Serious, or “class C”, violations pose an immediate risk to the health and safety of tenants. This can look like roaches, rodents, broken plumbing, problems with heat or hot water and peeling lead paint when young children are present. </p>

    <p> Lucy Block is a Research and Policy Associate for ANHD and manages its Displacement Alert Portal. It’s her job to make sense of all the numbers and put them into perspective. For example, the top 10 community districts in New York City where affordable housing is most threatened, have populations with over 75% people of color, according to ANHD.</p>

    <p> “We absolutely believe that there is a strong correlation between where people are at risk of losing their houses, where they're at higher risk of eviction, where they're living in housing with worse conditions, and BIPOC communities in New York City,” Block said. “And that's because of the history of racist, housing, development, and planning as well as just general structural barriers and issues.”
